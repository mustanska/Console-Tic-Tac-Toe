This console game was created during my education at Software University. It is a simple version of "Tic-Tac-Toe" game.

Everyone probably knows about the game Tic Tac Toe.
For those who don't know, the game is played with only two players. The two players choose what names they will have, and the first player chooses what symbol ("X" or "O") they will play with. The other one has no choice.

There are two ways out of the game - someone wins or the board is full. 
The winner is the one who has 3 consecutive positions with his symbol in one of the dimensions - in a row, in a column or in one of the diagonals in the board.
